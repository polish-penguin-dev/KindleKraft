## Welcome To **KindleKraft**!

An Optimised, Modern Way To Run Minecraft Servers On Jailbroken Kindles.

Inspired By `XTMCSH`! Runs Spigot 1.7.X-1.8.X (Modded) + Azul Zulu JDK 8. 

## Installation Guide

> [!WARNING]  
> Ensure Your Kindle Is On A Firmware Version Below 5.16.3! (This Software Utilises Soft-Float JDK Installation, Breaks Scripts...)

### Prerequisites

- kTerm
- Kindle (Firmware < 5.16.3)

### Installation

- Take The Extension From Releases, Put It Into Your **extensions** Folder.
- Take The Archive, Put It In The Root Of Your Kindle. Do *NOT* Extract!
- All Files Can Be Found In The GitHub Releases Tab.

### Running

- Open 'KindleKraft' In KUAL, Run 'Install KindleKraft'.
- This May Take A While, Please Be Patient!
- After It's Complete, Run 'Launch'.
- This Will Open kTerm - Run 'kindlekraft' In The Window To Get Started.

> [!TIP]
> Use 256M Swapfile For Best Performance, Or If You Experience Issues With 128M.

- 'kindlekraft -s' Will Start The Server.
- 'kindlekraft -i' Will Retrieve Private IP Address.

### You're Done!

- You Can Now Join The Server On A 1.7.X Or 1.8.X Client.
- For Best Results, I Recommend Using The Latest Version + ViaFabricPlus.
- Like What You See? Leave A Star!
